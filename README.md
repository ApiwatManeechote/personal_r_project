# Chinook Digital Media Store: Visualization and Model Training

## R Project Overview

Welcome to my R Project!

This project showcases how I use R for data analysis, visualization, and model training on the insights from the SQL queries.
My goal is to illustrate the data from SQL queries to find clear results and train models that help make data-driven decisions/recommendations.

## Dataset: Chinook

The database I'll be using for R project is still the same chinook_updated.db file as same as the SQL projcet.
However, we will focus on visualization that can be presented to some party that these insights from our SQL queries are matter to them.
Therefore, I divide this project into 2 parts.

* **Visualization:** Contains connecting the database and visualize the data.
* **Correlation and Model Training:** Contains correlation from the data, model training for total_sales.

## Mini Games

This is an additional part where I utilize R knowledge to create something that could be fun and interesting for me with How to play for each game.
* Star Wars Theme Dialogue
* Pokemon Power Game
